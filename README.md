# d3-assignment

Bharat  Pant (2484219)

I used Bootstrap 5 to style it.
I also have a live working version, deployed here : http://d3assignment.uk/


Note: I have used D3 version-4 in my assignment. It requires XMLHttpRequest which is unfortunately blocked by chrome web browser if we are browsing the files locally.

That is why it is advised to open it in a either a web server( localhost will work) or mozilla firefox browser.
